Attach the Path Follow Script to the object you want to follow a path, then open the Path/Path creator Window.

Opening the path creator window will create render lines script on the path follower object. So if you delete the render lines script just open the window.
Opening the path creator window will create a Character controller on the path follower object if one doesn't allready exist.

WARNING - Deleting a node in the Inspector will break the following script and break the delete nodes function.

Recommended Path follow Script Variables -

-Speed = 0.04
-Turn Damping = 1

Thankyou for using the path follow Pack by X0FloH.
